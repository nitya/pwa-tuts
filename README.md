# PWA Tutorials - By Example

## Objective
Create a set of code samples that explore creating, building, deploying, and testing, a basic PWA - using popular front-end frameworks and static site generators.

> How do we choose the frameworks and generators for this purpose?

We can look at [Stack Overflow Report 2021](https://insights.stackoverflow.com/survey/2021#section-most-popular-technologies-web-frameworks), [Stack Overflow Trends](https://insights.stackoverflow.com/trends?tags=jquery%2Cangularjs%2Cangular%2Creactjs%2Cvue.js%2Csvelte), [Octoverse](https://octoverse.github.com/) etc. for broad trends. For now, I'll focus on [Rising Stars of JS, 2022](https://risingstars.js.org/2021/en) which reflects popular and _emerging_ technologies that are less likely to have established tutorials already out there.

## Tutorial Structure

Ideally the tutorial should show the following steps:

| Step | Description |
|:---|:---|
| Basic App | Build the boilerplate app/site. Preview locally to verify things work. Run Lighthouse audit (mobile, desktop) and save scores - optional. |
| Deploy to Azure | I'll use [Azure App Service]() for web apps and [Azure Static Web Apps](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/static-web-apps/) for static site generators, for convenience.|
| PWABuilder Audit | Run PWABuilder audit to get PWA-readiness score for deployment to App Stores. Use recommendations to fix score and get basic PWA. |
| Playwright Test | Integrate Playwright end-to-end testing, automate with actions, show basic mobile/desktop screenshots capture as proof.|
| Lighthouse Audit | Run final audit with Lighthouse to gauge overall performance, accessibility and SEO compliance - plus reinforce PWA improvements. |
